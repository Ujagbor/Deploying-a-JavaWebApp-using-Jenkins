#### Title: **Java WebApp CI/CD with Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and Slack Integration**

#### Description:
This repository demonstrates the full setup and integration of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Java WebApp using Jenkins. It covers the complete workflow from installation to deployment, incorporating best practices for automated builds, code quality analysis, artifact management, and continuous feedback.

#### Steps Covered:

1. **Installing Jenkins**:
   - Instructions for setting up Jenkins on a server.
   - Configuration steps to get Jenkins up and running.

2. **Setting Up a Java WebApp (Using Maven) in GitHub**:
   - Creation of a basic Java WebApp using Maven.
   - Repository structure and Maven configuration details (`pom.xml` setup).

3. **Automating Build and Deployment of Java WebApp Using Jenkins Freestyle Job**:
   - Step-by-step guide to create and configure a Jenkins freestyle job.
   - Integration of the Java WebApp project with Jenkins for automated builds and deployments.

4. **Configuring Webhooks in GitHub to Trigger Builds Instantly in Jenkins**:
   - Detailed process for setting up GitHub webhooks.
   - How to ensure that code changes in GitHub trigger Jenkins builds automatically.

5. **Verifying Automated Builds and Deployments**:
   - Instructions to make code changes in the Java WebApp.
   - Validation steps to confirm Jenkins builds and deploys the application automatically upon code changes.

6. **Setting Up SonarQube and Integrating with Jenkins**:
   - Installation and configuration of SonarQube for code quality analysis.
   - Integration of SonarQube with Jenkins to include static code analysis in the build process.

7. **Nexus 3 Setup Using Docker and Integration with Jenkins**:
   - Setup of Nexus 3 repository manager using Docker.
   - Configuration steps to integrate Nexus with Jenkins for artifact management and storage.

8. **Sending Push Notifications to Slack from Jenkins (Continuous Feedback)**:
   - Configuration of Jenkins to send build and deployment notifications to Slack.
   - Steps to create a Slack app and integrate it with Jenkins for continuous feedback.

9. **Slack-triggered Builds**:
   - Setting up Jenkins to allow build triggers from Slack.
   
#### Key Features:
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive setup for continuous integration and continuous deployment using Jenkins.
- **Maven Integration**: Building and managing dependencies of a Java WebApp with Maven.
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Integration with SonarQube for static code analysis and quality checks.
- **Artifact Management**: Use of Nexus 3 for managing build artifacts and dependencies.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Continuous feedback to developers via Slack notifications on build and deployment statuses.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Utilizing Docker for setting up Nexus 3, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment.

#### Usage:
